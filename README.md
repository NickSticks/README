About me ~ 

Hi, my name is Nick and I’m beginning a journey of self-taught coding. I'm not starting from scratch as due to my degree (Physics) and current role (Financial Analyst) I already know 1. The basics of Python and 2. SQL code to a high level. 

Therefore, my aims for this learning program are:
•	Get better at Python
•	Improve my data analysis skills
•	Improve my data modelling skills
•	Train myself in clean and concise code writing.
•	Be able to take these skills into the workplace/ allow me to change careers to a more tech focussed role.
If you see/read this and feel I could learn or contribute to your project, please reach out to me.
